- **Basic visuals**: The game includes basic graphics using Raylib.

## Requirements

- **C++ compiler**: You need a C++ compiler like GCC or Clang to compile the game.
- **Raylib**: Ensure you have the Raylib library installed. You can follow the instructions on the [Raylib GitHub page](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) to set up Raylib.
